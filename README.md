# The Real Doctors

### A React app

Check out our deployed version [here](https://the-real-doctors.herokuapp.com/).

A google search for a medical condition brings up the most popular instead of the most reliable and accurate. Sensational articles will always rank higher than boring medical journal articles.

The Real Doctors was created to bridge this gap between people and medical doctors. All of the articles are written by board certified physicians. Whether it's an opinion piece or comments about a medical study, all the material is guaranteed to be written by doctors.
